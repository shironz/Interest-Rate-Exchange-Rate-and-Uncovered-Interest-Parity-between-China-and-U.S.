# Interest-Rate-Exchange-Rate-and-Uncovered-Interest-Parity-between-China-and-U.S.

ABSTRACT: 

The uncovered interest parity (UIP) puzzle concerns the empirical regularity that
high interest rate countries tend to have high expected returns on short time deposits.
We test whether UIP holds between China and USA. If it holds, this could partially ex-
plain that China is not an exchange rate manipulation country. Using Fama regression,
our results reject UIP holds between China and U.S.
